# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection AI with CNN-based Image Segmentation

This repository contains my **Undergraduate Senior Design Project** for the **Engineering Design course**, where I successfully achieved a grade of **95/100**.  
The project focuses on **breast cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **image segmentation techniques** on a dataset of **7,560 mammogram images**.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection is vital for timely treatment and improved survival rates.  
In this project, I implemented a **deep learning-based diagnostic system** to:

- 📷 **Analyze mammogram images**  
- ✂️ **Segment suspicious tumor regions**  
- 🤖 **Classify segmented areas** as benign or malignant  

The system serves as a **decision support tool** for radiologists, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing examination time.
